-- FIX MESSED UP MERGING AFTER GIT SUBMODULE FIASCO

-- add Model.serialize and Model.load

-- Modify current() to send change messages like set, as in after the current value has
   changed passing the old-value as the event value.  This allows for
   this.on('change:current', this.render) to work properly.

-- add Model.requuest/ajax, which binds this properly in sucess: and
   failure:.  Write for both node (using request) and browser so that
   node package doesn't depend on jquery.

-- test to ensure arguments are passed to init function

-- should add/remove/etc send "change" messages?
